{"name":"Garret Sanders E-Portfolio","tagline":"","body":"# Garret Sander \r\n\r\n##About \r\n\r\nHi! My name is Garret Sander and I am currently in my second year of Computer Systems Technology at SIAST Kelsey Campus. I grew up on a farm 1/2 km from the town of Colonsay where I attended Colonsay school from kindergarten to grade 12. I was involved in many extracurricular activities associated with the school such as: \r\n* Drama \r\n* Volleyball \r\n* Curling \r\n* Student Representative Counsel \r\n\r\nWhile serving on the Student Representative Counsel as the Spirit Director, I was in charge of pep-rallies for the school as well as any volunteer work that the SRC volunteered for, such as being a number runner at Telemiracle in 2007. I was also fortunate enough to attend the Provincial Student Leadership Conference in Swift Current in 2005, as well as the Canadian Student Leadership Conference in Fredericton New Brunswick in 2006.\r\n\r\nOutside of school, I participated in a minor hockey league until the age of 18, as well as Rugby from grade 10-12. In my spare time I enjoy camping, fishing, playing guitar, playing beach Volleyball and of course, playing video games. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
