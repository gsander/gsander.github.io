<p>Hi! My name is Garret Sander and I am currently in my second year of Computer Systems Technology at SIAST Kelsey Campus. I grew up on a farm 1/2 km from the town of Colonsay where I attended Colonsay school from kindergarten to grade 12. I was involved in many extracurricular activities associated with the school such as: </p>

<ul>
<li>Drama </li>
<li>Volleyball </li>
<li>Curling </li>
<li>Student Representative Counsel </li>
</ul><p>While serving on the Student Representative Counsel as the Spirit Director, I was in charge of pep-rallies for the school as well as any volunteer work that the SRC volunteered for, such as being a number runner at Telemiracle in 2007. I was also fortunate enough to attend the Provincial Student Leadership Conference in Swift Current in 2005, as well as the Canadian Student Leadership Conference in Fredericton New Brunswick in 2006.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I participated in a minor hockey league until the age of 18, as well as Rugby from grade 10-12. In my spare time I enjoy camping, fishing, playing guitar, playing beach Volleyball and of course, playing video games. </p>
